Beat annotations:

Symbol:	              Meaning:

· or N	              Normal beat
L	                  Left bundle branch block beat
R	                  Right bundle branch block beat
A	                  Atrial premature beat
a	                  Aberrated atrial premature beat
J	                  Nodal (junctional) premature beat
S	                  Supraventricular premature beat
V	                  Premature ventricular contraction
F	                  Fusion of ventricular and normal beat
[	                  Start of ventricular flutter/fibrillation
!	                  Ventricular flutter wave
]	                  End of ventricular flutter/fibrillation
e	                  Atrial escape beat
j	                  Nodal (junctional) escape beat
E	                  Ventricular escape beat
/	                  Paced beat
f	                  Fusion of paced and normal beat
x	                  Non-conducted P-wave (blocked APB)
Q	                  Unclassifiable beat
|	                  Isolated QRS-like artifact




Rhythm annotations appear below the level used for beat annotations:

(AB	                  Atrial bigeminy
(AFIB	              Atrial fibrillation
(AFL	              Atrial flutter
(B	                  Ventricular bigeminy
(BII	              2° heart block
(IVR	              Idioventricular rhythm
(N	                  Normal sinus rhythm
(NOD	              Nodal (A-V junctional) rhythm
(P	                  Paced rhythm
(PREX	              Pre-excitation (WPW)
(SBR	              Sinus bradycardia
(SVTA	              Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia
(T	                  Ventricular trigeminy
(VFL	              Ventricular flutter
(VT	                  Ventricular tachycardia




Signal quality and comment annotations appear above the level used for beat annotations:

qq	                  Signal quality change: the first character (`c' or `n') indicates the quality of the upper signal (clean or noisy), 
                      and the second character indicates the quality of the lower signal
U	                  Extreme noise or signal loss in both signals: ECG is unreadable
M (or MISSB)	      Missed beat
P (or PSE)	          Pause
T (or TS)	          Tape slippage
