# This file is dedicated to extacting features from the QRS complex of each heartbeat.
# the following temporal characteristics of the QRS complex are calculated: 
# the total duration of the QRS complex (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑤), 
# the width of the QRS complex at half of the peak value (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑤2), 
# the width of the QRS complex at a quarter of the peak value (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑤4), 
# the distance between the peak of the Q wave, 
# and the peak of the S wave (𝑄𝑆𝑑).


# A detailed description of the extraction procedure is provided below:

# The R spike annotations provided with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database are used as a marker to separate and identify the beats. 
# At each beat location, a segment of 640 ms of signal (164 samples for 256 Hz) is considered, 
# 373 ms before the annotation (95 samples for 256 Hz), and 267 ms (68 samples for 256 Hz) after it. 
# The mean of the signal segment is subtracted from each sample in order to remove the baseline. 
# The absolute maximum value of the signal 100 ms before and after the annotation (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥) is considered as a reference point. 
# Though such value usually corresponds to the database R spike annotation and the peak of the R wave in typical normal heartbeats, 
# this is not always the case because the QRS may have a complex morphology 
# and fall into one of the broad categories of the standard nomenclature where the R wave is not the one with the highest amplitude [39]. 
# Therefore, only if 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 is positive is it immediately marked as the peak of the R wave (𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘). 
# Starting from 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥, ten fiducial points are identified: the two locations where the signal reaches half the value of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/2𝑎,𝑏), 
# the two locations where the signal reaches a quarter of the value of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/4𝑎,𝑏), the peak value of the R wave (𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘), the peak value of the Q wave (𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘), 
# the peak value of the S wave (𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘), the beginning of the QRS complex (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡), the end of the QRS complex (𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑑), and the peak value of the P wave (𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘). 

# Many of the mentioned fiducial points are individuated by looking for the inflection points in the signal 
# and identifying the locations where the signal's first derivative changes direction. For this, a two-point numerical differentiation is applied to the signal. 
# The procedure for identifying the fiducial points can be described with the following steps:

# 1) Assume that 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘, 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘, 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘, and 𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal zero and that the corresponding waves are not present.

# 2) If 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 is positive, then make 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥.

# 3) Look backward from 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and evaluate the signal and its inflection points in this way:
# (a) Make 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/2𝑎 equal to the first location where the signal goes below half of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥.
# (b) Make 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/4𝑎 equal to the first location where the signal goes below a quarter of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥.
# (c) If the first inflection point is negative and 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is not zero, then 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equals the value at such point.
# (d) If the first inflection point is positive or zero and 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is not zero, then it is marked as 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡, and 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is considered zero.
# (e) If the first inflection point is positive and 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is zero, then make 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to the value at such point and make 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to QRS max.
# (f) If the second inflection point is negative, 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is zero, and 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 is positive, then make 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to the value at such point.
# (g) If 𝑄𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is not zero and the signal crosses zero, then the first non-negative point is marked as 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡.
# (h) If the second inflection point is positive or zero and 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 has not been found yet, then it is marked as 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡.

# 4) Look forward from 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and evaluate the signal and its inflection points in this way:
# (a) Make 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/2𝑏 equal to the first location where the signal goes below half of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥.
# (b) Make 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥/4𝑏 equal to the first location where the signal goes below a quarter of 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥.
# (c) If the first inflection point is negative and 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is not zero, then make 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to the value at such point.
# (d) If 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is not zero and the signal cross zero, then the first non-negative point is marked as 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑑.
# (e) If the second inflection point is positive or zero and 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑑 has not been found yet, then it is marked as 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑑.

# 5) Find the maximum value of the signal in the segment that goes between 233 ms (60 samples for 256 Hz) and 67 ms (17 samples for 256 Hz) before 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡. 
# If such value is greater than three times, the standard deviation of the signal during the 67 ms preceding the segment in consideration, 
# and its position corresponds to an inflection point in the signal, then make 𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 equal to such a value.
