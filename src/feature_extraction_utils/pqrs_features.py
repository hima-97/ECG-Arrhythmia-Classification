# This file is dedicated to extacting features from the QRS complex of each heartbeat.
# the following temporal characteristics of the QRS complex are calculated: 
# the total duration of the QRS complex (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë§), 
# the width of the QRS complex at half of the peak value (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë§2), 
# the width of the QRS complex at a quarter of the peak value (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë§4), 
# the distance between the peak of the Q wave, 
# and the peak of the S wave (ùëÑùëÜùëë).


# A detailed description of the extraction procedure is provided below:

# The R spike annotations provided with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database are used as a marker to separate and identify the beats. 
# At each beat location, a segment of 640 ms of signal (164 samples for 256 Hz) is considered, 
# 373 ms before the annotation (95 samples for 256 Hz), and 267 ms (68 samples for 256 Hz) after it. 
# The mean of the signal segment is subtracted from each sample in order to remove the baseline. 
# The absolute maximum value of the signal 100 ms before and after the annotation (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•) is considered as a reference point. 
# Though such value usually corresponds to the database R spike annotation and the peak of the R wave in typical normal heartbeats, 
# this is not always the case because the QRS may have a complex morphology 
# and fall into one of the broad categories of the standard nomenclature where the R wave is not the one with the highest amplitude [39]. 
# Therefore, only if ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• is positive is it immediately marked as the peak of the R wave (ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò). 
# Starting from ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•, ten fiducial points are identified: the two locations where the signal reaches half the value of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/2ùëé,ùëè), 
# the two locations where the signal reaches a quarter of the value of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/4ùëé,ùëè), the peak value of the R wave (ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò), the peak value of the Q wave (ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò), 
# the peak value of the S wave (ùëÜùëùùëíùëéùëò), the beginning of the QRS complex (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë°), the end of the QRS complex (ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëíùëõùëë), and the peak value of the P wave (ùëÉùëùùëíùëéùëò). 

# Many of the mentioned fiducial points are individuated by looking for the inflection points in the signal 
# and identifying the locations where the signal's first derivative changes direction. For this, a two-point numerical differentiation is applied to the signal. 
# The procedure for identifying the fiducial points can be described with the following steps:

# 1) Assume that ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò, ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò, ùëÜùëùùëíùëéùëò, and ùëÉùëùùëíùëéùëò equal zero and that the corresponding waves are not present.

# 2) If ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• is positive, then make ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•.

# 3) Look backward from ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• and evaluate the signal and its inflection points in this way:
# (a) Make ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/2ùëé equal to the first location where the signal goes below half of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•.
# (b) Make ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/4ùëé equal to the first location where the signal goes below a quarter of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•.
# (c) If the first inflection point is negative and ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò is not zero, then ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò equals the value at such point.
# (d) If the first inflection point is positive or zero and ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò is not zero, then it is marked as ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë°, and ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò is considered zero.
# (e) If the first inflection point is positive and ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò is zero, then make ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to the value at such point and make ùëÜùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to QRS max.
# (f) If the second inflection point is negative, ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò is zero, and ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• is positive, then make ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to the value at such point.
# (g) If ùëÑùëùùëíùëéùëò is not zero and the signal crosses zero, then the first non-negative point is marked as ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë°.
# (h) If the second inflection point is positive or zero and ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë° has not been found yet, then it is marked as ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë°.

# 4) Look forward from ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë• and evaluate the signal and its inflection points in this way:
# (a) Make ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/2ùëè equal to the first location where the signal goes below half of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•.
# (b) Make ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•/4ùëè equal to the first location where the signal goes below a quarter of ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëöùëéùë•.
# (c) If the first inflection point is negative and ùëÖùëùùëíùëéùëò is not zero, then make ùëÜùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to the value at such point.
# (d) If ùëÜùëùùëíùëéùëò is not zero and the signal cross zero, then the first non-negative point is marked as ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëíùëõùëë.
# (e) If the second inflection point is positive or zero and ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëíùëõùëë has not been found yet, then it is marked as ùëÑùëÖùëÜùëíùëõùëë.

# 5) Find the maximum value of the signal in the segment that goes between 233 ms (60 samples for 256 Hz) and 67 ms (17 samples for 256 Hz) before ùëÑùëÖùëÜùë†ùë°ùëéùëüùë°. 
# If such value is greater than three times, the standard deviation of the signal during the 67 ms preceding the segment in consideration, 
# and its position corresponds to an inflection point in the signal, then make ùëÉùëùùëíùëéùëò equal to such a value.
